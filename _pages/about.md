¡Bienvenidos! My name is Nathalie G. Rivera-Torres. I am a graduate student at the University at Albany, in the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, working under the advisement of Dr. Kristen Corbosiero and Dr. Brian Tang. 

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and since I was a kid, I had a natural curiosity for tropical meteorology. Therefore, I decided to study physics, mathematics, and meteorology at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. I graduated with a B.S. in Theoretical Physics and a minor in Applied Mathematics in 2019. After the impact of Hurricane Maria back in 2017, I started to research tropical cyclones, how their intensity and structure change, their effects, and the importance of numerical weather prediction.
 
My main career goal is to work towards a better understanding of atmospheric phenomena and better forecasting to minimize damage to life and property and contribute to developing resilient communities.
