Welcome! My name is Nathalie Rivera Torres. I am a Ph.D student at the University at Albany, in the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, working under the advisement of Dr. Kristen Corbosiero and Dr. Brian Tang. My research is focused on tropical cyclones, and I am currently studying the factors associated with the downshear reformation of these systems. I graduated from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez with a B.S in Theoretical Physics and a minor in Applied Mathematics in 2019.
