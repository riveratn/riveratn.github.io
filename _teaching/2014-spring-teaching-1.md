The atmospheric processes involved in a tropical cyclone are affected by topographical factors
during and after landfall. Interactions with land can change the tropical cyclone’s
structure and behavior and, ultimately, its impact on the landmass. However, one of today’s
forecasting challenges is that numerical weather prediction models cannot resolve many 
factors that influence surface weather, resulting in a forecast that predicts the expected behavior
of a tropical cyclone moving over a smooth landmass. Therefore, these models do not accurately
represent the impact at landfall of these systems in regions characterized by complex
terrain and multiple mountain ranges. This research project investigated how terrain resolution
affects the landfall and behavior of tropical cyclones focusing on the landfall of Hurricane Maria
in Puerto Rico in 2017.

Main Findings
======
A set of simulations were produced using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, where one used the default terrain resolution and the other used high-resolution terrain data. The wind speed, vertical velocity, and precipitation magnitude were shown to be higher in the island's mountainous interior when incorporating high-resolution terrain.
